Wojciech Pratkowiecki II UWr - coding text files with Huffman algorithm
## how to code/uncode file
To code/uncode the txt file you should run your program and pass data to it in terminal. The program must recieve 3 crucial informations:
1. letter - 'c' if you want to code file or 'u' if you want to uncode file
2. input_name - name of file ready to code/uncode
3. output_file - name of empty file you want to have the result of program in
